# Terminal Velocity
This repository holds the source code for Terminal Velocity. As this is part of a formal univeristy submission, no changes will occur here following Wed 10th April 2019.

## Installation
Jekyll is the only build tool used in this project. The requirements for local installation are [listed here](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/).

Once you have the requirements, run `bundle` to fetch any project dependencies. Then run `gem update` to ensure installed RubyGems.

- To build the project into a `./site` directory run `jekyll build`
- To run in a development server use `jekyll serve` and navigate to `http://localhost:4000`

If your global installation of bundler does not match the project, you may need to run `bundle exec jekyll build`.
